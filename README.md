Imagine that everything said here works for 9x9 puzzles now and I am
too lazy to change the readme

Solves 4x4 sudoku using game theory

Just input in matlab a array where the empty spots are 0's.

example:

S=[0,1,0,0;0,2,0,0;2,0,0,0;0,0,3,0]

sudoku(S)

ans =

     4     1     2     3
     3     2     4     1
     2     3     1     4
     1     4     3     2

This also the first thing I coded on my shiny new macbook!
